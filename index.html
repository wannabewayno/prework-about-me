      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Outside of work, I am a huge tinkerer, constantly working or designing projects. They have been small enough to begin with, but now... they're growing. I always seem to bit off more than I can chew, but that's what learning is all about.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Furthermost my dream job is one where I can intergrate my interests and my lifestyle. I would prefer to not have a 9-5, and have my hand in several honey pots of ideas/projects and developments working with passionate and insightful go-getters who I can constantly learn off, bounce ideas off and generally grow from.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Based in the Perth Hills</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web developer?, not my main interest, however the skills associated with a web developer interests me enough to pursue insight/work in for the time being</p>
